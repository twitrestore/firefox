## How it Works

TwitRestore is implemented as a Firefox extension with a content script that runs on Twitter's website. The content script is injected into the page and modifies the DOM to restore the classic Twitter branding. It replaces the X logo with the original Twitter logo, updates the title, and changes the favicon.
